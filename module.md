   <ul align="center">
      <li>1Ô∏è‚É£ In Cyber Security, there are many roles that involves networking</li>
      <li>2Ô∏è‚É£ Generally in hacking, you need to learn how to move, configure and troubleshoot networking issues/errors</li>
      <li>3Ô∏è‚É£ This skill will make you be able to identify vulnerabilities in companies or in your own local network. This also makes you safe when defending yourself or your company</li>

  <h1 align="center">Network</h1>
  <h4>A network can come with various styles. As for instance, your local network surely have a router, and devices connected to it (like phones and tvs), thats your network, your local network. Not diving more into it, lets learn about networking
  </h4>

  <h1 align="center">Hubs and Switches</h1>

  <h4>In order for computers to talk to each other, they need a cable attached to their ends. But how would multiple computers talk to each other? Well now we talking Hubs. They allow multiple computers to talk and communicate, like this:

![This is the hub picture](hub.png)
  
  </h4>

  <h4>
  But one problem with the Hub is that, whenever a ping request or message arrives to it, the message will duplicate itself to     other devices in that network, meaning, the Hub's only job is to duplicate traffic to all devices. To solve this, they made       Switches. Switches job is to hand the message over to the right destination without any trouble. This is how a small network      with a switch looks like
  </h4>

  <h1 align="center">Network layers (1-2)</h1>

  <h5>Layer 1: Hardware/Physical things, like cables </h5>
  <h5>Layer 2: Mac Address etc</h5>
  </h4>
After that the computers has been connected with a Switch, a problem remains. For instance, pc0 doesn't know the mac address of pc1, which is neccessary for the communication, since Switches only understands layer 2, or in other words, switches can only transfer a message with mac addresses attached to the message.This is where ARP (address resolution protocol) messages comes into play. The ARP message is a message that a device sends to all devices in the network in order to find out what the real destination's mac address is. Lets make a scenario. "Pc0 wants to communicate with pc1": 
  </h4>

  ![This is the switch picture](firstscene.png)

  <h3>Pc0 pings pc1 with this command "ping 192.168.1.2"</h3>
  <h4>üü© Green message: The ARP message, this message contains the ip address of the destination/receiver, and finds out the mac           address of it</h4>
  <h4>‚¨õ Black message: Actual ping request, this message contains the ip address of the sender and destination. But not the destination's mac address, that's the ARP's job</h4>
