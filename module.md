  <h1 align="center">Network</h1>
  <h4>A network can come in various styles. For instance, your local network surely has a router, and devices connected to it (like phones and tvs), that's your network, your local network. When we talk about layers, we mean the blocks that build up the function to for example communicate. More on that soon. Not diving more into it, let us learn about networking
  </h4>

  <h1 align="center">Hubs and Switches</h1>

  <h4> For computers to talk to each other, they need a cable attached to their ends. But how would multiple computers talk to each other? Well, now we talking Hubs. They allow multiple computers to talk and communicate, like this:

![This is the hub picture](images/hub.png)
<img src="images/realhub.png" width="200" />
  
  </h4>

  <h4>
  But one problem with the Hub is that, whenever a ping request or message arrives to it, the message will duplicate itself to other devices in that network, meaning, the Hub's only job is to simply repeat the electrical signal to all connected devices. To solve this, they made Switches. The switch's job is to forward frames to a specific device associated with the destination mac address. This is how a small network with a switch looks like
  </h4>

  ![This is the switch picture](images/switch.png)
  <img src="images/realswitch.png" width="200" />

  <h1 align="center">Network layers (1-2)</h1>

  <h5>Layer 1: Hardware/Physical things, like cables </h5>
  <h5>Layer 2: Mac Address, etc</h5>

  <ul>
   <ls>
  <li>Hardware: This is the physical things like the metal and components inside of your computer</li>
  <li>Mac address: Fixed code on a device. Every device has a mac address. This is like an IP address or home address. This code will rarely change, because it is like an identifier for the device. You could change the mac address through a software </li>
  </ls>
  </ul>
  
  </h4>
After that the computers has been connected with a Switch, a problem remains. For instance, pc0 doesn't know the mac address of pc1, which is neccessary for the communication, since Switches only operate at layer 2, or in other words, switches can only transfer a message with mac addresses attached to the message. This is where ARP (address resolution protocol) messages comes into play. The ARP message is a message that a device sends to other devices in the network in order to find out what their mac address is. Let's make a scenario. "Pc0 wants to communicate with pc1": 
  </h4>

  ![This is the switch picture](images/firstscene.png)

  <h3>Pc0 pings pc1 with this command "ping 192.168.1.2"</h3>
  <h4>üü© Green message: The ARP message, this message contains the ip address of the destination/receiver and finds out the mac address of it</h4>
  <h4>‚¨õ Black message: Actual ping request, this message contains the ip address of the sender and destination. But not the destination's mac address, that's the ARP's job
  </h4>

  <h4>This is what the ARP message currently contains:</h4>

  ![This is the switch picture](images/arpsent.png)

  </ul>
  
<ul>
   <ls>
  <li>Ethernet: The cable used to connect the computer and the switch</li>
  <li>00D0.9745.1420: This is the source mac address, aka the sender's mac address, which is pc0</li>
  <li>FFFF.FFFF.FFFF: This is the blank mac address holder for the destination's mac address, which is pc1's mac address</li>
  <li>Src. ip: The ip address of the sender/pc0</li>
  <li>Dest ip: Ip address of the destination, aka pc1's ip address</li>
  </ls>
  </ul>

  ![This is the process picture](images/secondscene.png)

  <h4>
    Both ARP (üü© ) and the ping request (‚¨õ) has reached the Switch. The Switch knows that this is an ARP message, and therefore duplicates it to the other devices:
  
  </h4>

![This is the process picture](images/thirdscene.png)

<p></p>

![This is the process picture](images/secondscene.png)
  <h4>
    Since the ip address doesn't match for pc2, it will be destroyed. In the other hand, it matches the pc1's ip address, which       means the ARP request has been successfully delivered. Now the ARP message has to be sent back to pc0 so that pc0 acknowledges that it has been delivered and read. Now the last step is for pc1 do contact pc0 back.
  </h4>

  ![This is the process picture](images/forthscene.png)

  <h4>
    Now, pc0 and the switch have learned where pc1 lives through its mac address. From now on, the ARP message is useless because pc0 and pc1 are friends, both of them know where they each live, which means they are now free to communicate with each other without any issues through mac addresses. All of this is happening within seconds, but we just slowed down the progress so it becomes easier. This is how it looks like behind the scenes:

  </h4>

  <h1 align="center">OSI model & TCP/IP model (layer 3-7)</h1>

  <h4 align="center">There are two main network structures. They are called the OSI model and the TCP/IP model. The OSI model has 7 layers, while TCP/IP combines the 5th, 6th, and 7th layers into one layer, which is equal to only 5 layers.</h4>

  <h2>---> Layer3 <---</h2>

  <h4>This section is mostly about ip addresses, routers, and packets.</h4>

  <li><strong>Ip address:</strong>

  Think of it as a home address but for devices. You use ip addresses to send messages, receive messages, yet you can move to a different house, which is equivalent to a device switching networks and getting a new ip address, for example, when connecting to a restaurant free network.
  </li>
  
  <ul>

  <li><strong>Router:</strong>

  Routers can forward a message using ip addresses. When a message reaches your local router from the inside (LAN: local area network) or outside (WAN: wide area network), it will do its things according to the configuration.

  ![This is the process picture](images/routerr.png)
    
  </li>

  <li><strong>Packets:</strong>

  <strong>The messages that you are sending when working with layer 3 are called "packets", while for example in layer 2 they are called "frames". </strong> 
  </li>
  
</ul>

<h2>----> Layer4 <----</h2>

  <h4 >This section is mostly about transport protocols</h4>

  <ul>
   <ls>
      <li><strong>Transport protocols:</strong>

  <strong>When your router sends a message through the internet, to for example enter a website, it typically uses the TCP (transmission control protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol). For now just know that TCP is more reliable, while UDP is faster. Additionally, you would use the so called "3 way handshake".</strong>

<li><strong>3 way handshake:</strong>

  <br>

  <strong>
  
  In order for you to visit a website, like youtube.com, you need to first communicate. So you open your browser and type the website. Secondly, behind the scenes, you send a message called "syn" (synchronize), which is a message that sees if a website is up. When the message reaches, for example, youtube, then it will respond with a "syn ack" (synchronize-acknowledge) message saying "hello client, im online". Lastly when youtube sends the message back to you, you will respond with an "ack" (acknowledge) message saying "okay we are good to go". Now you are in the website. For more on this, check out this youtube video:

  </ul>

  <h2>-----> Layer 5 <-----</h2>

  <h4>The session layer is all about keeping the connection between you and the website you are trying to interact with. More of it soon
</h4>

<ul>
  </ul>

  <h2>------> Layer 6 <------</h2>

  
  <h4>The presentation layer handles data formatting, encryption, and compression so the data can be properly understood by the browser. The browser which is the application layer, processes this data to display the website‚Äôs graphical interface (GUI).</h4>

<ul>
   <ls>
      <li><strong>Data format & file type:</strong>

  <strong>When you enter a website, you are mostly greeted with a .html file. This is a file that renders the website. From the background color to all the text, font, and so on. The most common data format/file types are .html, .js, and .css.</strong> 
  </li>
  <li>.js: Java script. Used when you want to script a button or animations</li>
  <li>.css: It's a programming language called "CSS". It is used to fade, shade, and make everything seem much cleaner and better. </li>
   </ls>
  </ul>

  <h2>-------> Layer 7 <-------</h2>

  <h4>This is the last layer, and its called the "application" layer. This layer is mostly about the browser, protocols such as http and https</h4>

<ul>
   <ls>
  <li>Browser: When you open your browser and type the website, in a way, you interact with the 7th layer. More of this under</li>

  <br>
     
  <li>Ports: A port is like a tunnel that allows connections. When you start your computer, by default you will create different ports so that your computer works properly. Ports allow connections, for example, when you visit youtube, there has to be a way for the flow of information to pass by, which is through ports. They allow connections, and information to pass in and out of it. Ports also have the so called "port number" which is like an ip address but for ports. Its a location for the port. For instance, if you want to connect to a port, you would specify the port number. 
  </li>

  <br>

  <li>Http (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): This is a protocol that lets you connect to websites. To create a http connection, you will need a port. The port number for http is 80. Note that you can change the port number but that the deafult</li>

  <br>
  
  <li>Https (Hypertext Transfer Protocol secure): Updates version of http and does the same job but more secure. It encrypts the traffic and is overall more secure. The port number for https is 443. Note that you can change the port number, but that the default </li>
  
  </ls>
  </ul>

  <h2 align="center">What happens when you enter Youtube? (or any website)</h2>

  <h3>Client's side</h3>

  <h4>Now you are familiar with some layers and also understand those layers a little. Now i will walk you through what happens when you enter a website, short explained.</h4>

  <ul>
    <li> First, you open your browser and type "https://youtube.comm". This happens at the application Layer (layer 7), where the browser uses protocols like https to send requests and receive files from the server.
  
  </li>

  <br>

  <li>Secondly, when the files like .html, .css, and .js arrive, the presentation Layer (layer 6) takes care of decrypting and decompressing the data so the browser can understand it.
  </li>

  <br>

  <li>Thirdly, the session Layer (layer 5) helps manage the connection between your computer and the server by keeping the session open while you browse and making sure it can close properly when you‚Äôre done.
  </li>

  <br>

  <li>Fourthly, there has to be a way for all this information to be transported. That is exactly what the 4th layer (transport) is about. It chooses a protocol to transport the message (request to visit the website). Typcially TCP or UDP. Additionally, you make the 3 way handshake which establishes a connection between you and the website.
  </li>

  <br>

  <li>Fifthly, now that the message is ready to be sent, it will use the ip address from your device, send it over to the router and the router will send the message forward over the internet. Aka layer 3.
  </li>

  <br>

  <li>Sixthly, Layer 2 takes the packets from layer 3 and puts them into frames. It uses mac addresses to make sure the data gets to the right device on the local network, like your router. It also checks for errors in the data to make sure nothing got corrupted. Examples of layer 2 protocols are Ethernet and Wi-Fi.
  </li>

  <br>

  <li>Lastly, Layer 1 which is the lowest layer, is responsible for sending the raw bits as signals over cables or wirelessly. It decides how the signals are sent physically, like electrical signals through cables or radio waves for Wi-Fi. Your network card and cable or Wi-Fi antenna handle this part.
  </li>

  <br>

  <li>Note that this type of cool thing where the message goes down the layers and is being greeted with new and different layers is called encapsulation. The message is being attached with new protocols, layers and so on.
  </li>

  <br>

  <h3>Server's side (youtube)</h3>

  <h4>When your message arrives to the server, it will be uncapsulating, meaning, your messsage is being opened and read. First it begins with opening the first layer (layer2) and then layer 3 and so on. When youtube confirms the request, you will be granted access to the website. </h4>
